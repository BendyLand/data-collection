# Data Collection
**(Formerly Web Scraping)**

This repository will be for storing projects on basic web scraping and data collection. 

I currently have no experience with data collection. 

My goal is to use the following languages to learn (along with the purpose for each).


### Languages

 - Python
    - To learn basic data collection techniques and use cases. 

 - Scala
    - To practice data collection with my language of choice. 

 - Kotlin
    - Because Scala isn't as popular in the job market...

 - F#
    - To try a more functional approach.

 - Elixir 
    - To add (and practice) concurrency.


### Objective

Each finished project will serve a purpose, which may be 
the same or different between each of the languages. By the time I am finished
with this project in each language, I would like to have a more complete 
understanding of data collection tools, scenarios, and the main considerations 
for each.
